This project is a reference app for a typical JavaScript client focused single page application using Bootstrap, Backbone, Require, jQuery, and other JavaScript technologies. I'll be modifying this as I decied how best I like my reference implementation set up. This is an experiment as I often go into project with some stack decisions and technology configurations already decided. I've used all these techlogies in other project in different configurations so wanted to have a pure "ideal" reference so I could help guide my own understanding of the existing technology stack and hopefully have an influence on how it's developed in the future.
